## Logistic Regression and SVM

For this project, we used two datasets to perform logistic regression and SVM analysis on. First dataset is about loan payback and the second is about Persistency of drug. Through our studies, we calculated optimal models for future predictions of individuals repaying loans and persistence. We utilized logistic regression and SVM to predict the output classed because the goal variable in both sets is categorical and these methods are used to identify when events occur between classes. Our models help in understanding the persistence of the drug (persistence or not) according to the doctorâ€™s prescription as it is one of the challenges facing by all pharmaceutical business and to loaning companies.
